Interactive Resume & Technical Portfolio

Welcome to my resume! This project serves as a portfolio showcasing my technical skills and my willingness to learn new technologies.

Project Goals:

Learning: This project started as a self-improvement initiative to explore new technologies like Node.js and gain experience with DevOps and cloud tools. 
Customization: I built a basic website using Node.js and customized it by creating a logo, adjusting the design integrating my resume content. Feel free to suggest further improvements!
Deployment Exploration: I initially aimed for deployment on an AWS EC2 instance using Docker Compose. While I encountered some initial challenges, I gained valuable experience deploying containers and using Nginx as a reverse proxy. Subsequently, I experimented with CloudFormation for automated deployment. 
Cloud Migration: To explore cloud migration and to work with a serverless tool, I migrated the application to Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using Cloud Run for container deployment.
Infrastructure as Code: I leveraged Terraform, a technology I have professional experience with, for infrastructure provisioning on GCP. 
CI/CD (Planned): My next steps include integrating a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions, a tool I'm familiar with from previous production environments.
Downloadable Resume (Planned): I'm planning to implement a feature that allows users to download a PDF version of my resume, aiming to learn PDF generation in the process. 
Technologies Used:

Node.js
Docker
Terraform
AWS Tools (AWS EC2, S3, ECR.)
GCP Tools (Cloud Run, Cloud Storage, Artifact Registry and Application Load Balancer)
GitHub Actions (planned)
